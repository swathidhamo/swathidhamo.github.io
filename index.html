    <h2>So now let's talk a bit about me (hopefully I don't sound too narcisstic here :P)</h2> 
     
    

    <div id = "About Me">
     Considering the Indian populations and keeping in mind my pessimism I would say that I'm just another 18 year old who's trying to find out things I'm passionate about. I have always loved Roger Federer, Tennis, Pop songs and Formula one races.
     Another thing I love is to create something new which led me to love coding. As much as this may sound like flattery I'm just being honest here. Coding has given me this freedom to go about things the way I want to without having too many restrictions on the how part.
