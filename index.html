       <p> So you've come to my page. </p>

          Let's talk a bit about me (hopefully I don't sound too narcisstic here :P)
       </p>
       <div id="About Me">
       Considering the global population and keeping in mind my pessimistic nature I would say that I'm just another 18 year old who's trying to discover things I'm passionate about. I have always loved Roger Federer, Tennis, Pop songs and Formula one races.
       Another thing I love is to create something new which led me to love coding. As much as this may sound like flattery I'm just being honest here. Coding has given me this freedom to go about things the way I want to without having too many restrictions on the how part.

             <p> Like most of us out there I too have a passion for travelling which is why it's one of the things I would love to do at any point of time </p>

         Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to.

           I've always grown up being fascinated by the world and power of technology. Amongst other things machine learning and artificial intelligence interests me the most. I love to read up on how Deep Blue the chess computer that beat Garry Kasparov was made. Did you know that it was trained by a chess grandmaster himself and at times he recalled it making moves that an average algorthim based system would'nt make. 

          <p>
            I am an unfailing optimist who beleives that iRobot or Terminator like instances are works of paranoid-poets who would'nt have allowed the world to progress beyond the wheel's invention.

            Ever since the beginning of college I've been trying to learn more and more about web development, I've had a lot of fun making small games like the breakout game and just experimenting in general. Initially I found myself being more interested in backend but now I feel that both frontend and backend have their charm. It's fun to make this easier to work with, interactive and visually appealing and at the same time powerful.
